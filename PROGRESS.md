# Progress — Deployment & Agent Workstream

> Tracks the mentor-guided work layered on top of the research project
> (see `PROJECT_GRAPH_REPORT.md` and `README.md` for that work). This file
> covers the new `app/` layer: FastAPI, the web interface, and (in a later
> milestone) the LangGraph workflow.

## Milestone 1 — Repository audit (complete)

Findings (verified live, not assumed):
- Resume claims (Hit@10 0.694, MRR 0.618, Transformer F1 87.6–90.8%) checked against the actual `data/eval/*.json` reports — accurate, not rounded up.
- No FastAPI/UI/Docker/CI/LangGraph existed before this milestone.
- Cold-start model loading: ~13–30s; warm: retrieval 36ms, rerank 2.6s, generation 2.3s.
- Model footprint (measured, not download size): BGE-large + reranker together ≈ 1.3GB RSS CPU-only, sub-second CPU embedding latency (468ms for a short query). Qwen3 8B (Ollama) is the real resource bottleneck at 5.2GB.

## Milestone 2 — Usable application (complete)

```

**No existing research code was modified.** `app/rag_pipeline.py` and `app/generation/ollama_provider.py` import `scripts/fusion.py`, `scripts/rerank.py`, and `scripts/llm_client.py` exactly as they are — this is composition, not reimplementation.

### The demo-vs-research decision (and why)

Checked licenses directly from authoritative sources, not assumed:

| Dataset | License | Source checked |
|---|---|---|
| CORD | CC-BY-4.0, redistribution OK with attribution | `clovaai/cord` GitHub repo + HF dataset card (both confirm) |
| SROIE | **Unclear** — official source (`rrc.cvc.uab.es`) gates data behind competition registration; no public-redistribution grant found. A third party's MIT-licensed GitHub repo covers only their own code, not the receipt images they don't own. | `rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=13&com=downloads` |
| WildReceipt | **Unclear** — license explicitly listed as "N/A" | Official MMOCR docs (`mmocr.readthedocs.io`) |

Since 2 of 3 real sources are unclear, **the public demo uses 10 hand-authored synthetic receipts** (`demo_data/demo_chunks.jsonl`), each tagged `"source": "synthetic_demo"`. The real 3,712-document research corpus (`data/`) is untouched, stays local, and `APP_CONFIG=research` exists in config only for local/offline use — it is never the default and is not deployed.

**No research metrics are attached to the demo config.** The demo has not been evaluated the way the research system was (Steps 4–6) — it's a different, smaller, unevaluated corpus, and the UI/API say so.

### Generation: did the system already answer questions, or only retrieve?

Checked: `scripts/llm_client.py::generate_answer()` already existed from Step 4 (used inside the eval harness, not exposed as a service). **Reused, not reimplemented** — `app/generation/ollama_provider.py` imports its `build_prompt`/`strip_thinking` functions directly and adds what the research script didn't need: configurable base_url/model/timeout and `GenerationError` wrapping so API callers get a clean error instead of a raw exception.

### "Insufficient evidence" handling

No confidence threshold was ever established in the Step 4–6 research — inventing one now would be an unvalidated guess presented as a metric. Instead, this reuses the **already-existing prompt instruction** (`llm_client.py`'s prompt already tells the model to say "I don't know" when the context doesn't contain the answer) and detects that phrase. Verified for real: an off-topic question ("What is the capital of France?") correctly returned `has_sufficient_evidence: false`.

### Verification — commands actually run, with real output

```bash
# server
cp .env.example .env
venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# health/readiness
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
# -> {"status":"ok"}
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ready
# -> {"ready":true,"config":"demo","checks":{"index_files_present":true,"generation_provider_reachable":true}}

# real end-to-end query
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the total amount on the Example Grocers Inc. receipt?", "top_k": 3}'
# -> answer: "The total amount on the Example Grocers Inc. receipt is $42.17." (correct)
# -> sources[0].chunk_id: "demo_000" (correct document)
# -> has_sufficient_evidence: true

# insufficient-evidence path
curl -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "What is the capital of France?"}'
# -> answer: "I don't know.", has_sufficient_evidence: false

# validation
curl -X POST .../query -d '{"question": ""}'        # -> 422
curl -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "aaa...600 chars"}'  # -> 422

# web UI
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/   # -> 200, text/html

# full test suite
venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
# -> 16 passed, 3 warnings in 33.40s (includes 2 REAL, non-mocked integration tests)
```

### Known limitations (honest, not glossed over)

- **Cold start is real and unmitigated.** First query after Ollama's idle timeout costs ~15–30s. Not solved in this milestone — a deployment decision for Milestone 5 (keep-alive config, a warm-up endpoint, or accepting the latency with a UI loading message, which the current interface already does).
- **No rate limiting / concurrency limits yet** — deliberately deferred to Milestone 5 ("public demo controls"), since this isn't deployed yet.
- **Hosting platform not yet chosen.** Preliminary research (Hugging Face Spaces: 16GB RAM/2 CPU on free "CPU Basic" tier, but compute-backed Spaces may require a paid plan per community sources, not yet confirmed against primary docs) — to be finalized in Milestone 5, not assumed here.
- **`requirements.txt` as committed is research-only** (CUDA-pinned torch, includes training/eval-only packages like `ragas`/`FlagEmbedding`). A trimmed, deployment-appropriate requirements file is Milestone 5 work, not done yet.
- **The demo corpus is intentionally tiny (10 receipts)** — enough to prove the system works end-to-end, not a meaningful evaluation sample. No retrieval-quality claims are made about it.

### Files changed/added this milestone

New: `app/` (8 files), `demo_data/build_synthetic_demo_corpus.py`, `demo_data/demo_chunks.jsonl`, `tests/test_api.py`, `tests/test_integration.py`, `.env.example`, `pytest.ini`, `PROGRESS.md`.
Modified: `.gitignore` (added `demo_data/index/`).
Untouched: every file under `scripts/`, all research data, `PROJECT_GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `README.md`.

**Not started: LangGraph (Milestone 3), Docker/CI/deployment (Milestone 5), documentation of a public URL (Milestone 6) — per scope, paused here.**

## Milestone 2 extension — Upload your own receipt (complete)

Adds a second, fully isolated mode to the same application: upload a real JPG/PNG/PDF receipt and ask questions about it, without touching the research pipeline or its evaluation claims.

### What was built

```
app/upload/
├── extraction.py       # PDF text-layer + OCR fallback (PyMuPDF + Tesseract), timeout-wrapped
├── session.py           # SessionManager — per-browser-session storage, lazy TTL expiry
├── indexing.py          # builds a session-scoped FAISS+BM25 index (new code — see why below)
└── retriever_cache.py   # caches one HybridRetriever (UNMODIFIED scripts/fusion.py) per session
```
Plus: `app/main.py` gained `/upload`, `/session` (GET/DELETE), session-cookie handling, and a `mode` field on `/query`; `app/rag_pipeline.py` gained `answer_from_retriever()` (same rerank/generate/format logic as `answer()`, parameterized by retriever — this is how upload mode reuses generation without reimplementing it); `app/static/index.html` gained a mode tab, upload control, extracted-text panel, and "Clear uploaded receipts."

**Retrieval (`fusion.py`) and generation (`llm_client.py`/`ollama_provider.py`) are reused exactly as before — zero changes.** The one genuinely new piece is `indexing.py`: `embed_index.py` is a CLI-only script with no reusable function, and shelling out to it per upload would force a ~13s cold model-load on every single file. `indexing.py` follows its exact pattern (same model, same `IndexFlatIP`, same `metadata.jsonl`/`index_config.json` shape) but keeps one embedding model warm across uploads instead.

### A real blocker, resolved

This sandbox has no passwordless `sudo`, so I could not install the system `tesseract-ocr` package myself. **You ran the install yourself** (per your choice when asked) while everything else was built in parallel. Now resolved and fully re-verified:
- `tesseract --version` confirms **5.3.4** installed.
- Before testing through the app, ran tesseract directly on a synthetic test receipt image to confirm it reads cleanly in isolation.
- **Uploaded that image through the actual running API**: OCR ran (`used_ocr: true`), extracted text matched the raw tesseract output exactly ("OCR TEST DINER... TOTAL 19.00").
- **Asked a question requiring the OCR'd values** ("What is the total... and what did they order?") → correct answer ("$19.00 for a Burger, Fries, and Soda"), correct source citation (filename + matching excerpt), `has_sufficient_evidence: true`.
- PDF embedded-text extraction (no OCR needed) was already verified separately — most real PDFs have a text layer.
- The graceful-degradation path (clean 503 when OCR is unavailable) was verified earlier, before tesseract was installed, and remains in place as the fallback if OCR is ever unavailable again.

**The full upload → OCR → indexing → question → cited answer path is now genuinely verified end-to-end, not assumed.**

### Resource decision: upload's embedding model runs on CPU, not GPU

Demo mode's retriever (GPU, ~1.3GB VRAM) + reranker (GPU, ~2.2GB) + Qwen3 8B via Ollama (~5.2GB) already approach this machine's 8GB VRAM. Loading a *second* GPU copy of the embedding model for uploads risked exceeding it. Measured earlier (Milestone 1/2): CPU embedding costs ~468ms for a short query — negligible for a one-time per-upload indexing step, so `UPLOAD_EMBEDDING_DEVICE=cpu` by default, configurable.

### Session isolation — how it actually holds, not just claimed

- Session ID is an opaque, server-generated UUID in an HTTP-only cookie — the client never supplies or influences it.
- Each session's chunks/index live in their own directory under `/tmp/doc-rag-uploads/{session_id}/`, **outside the git repo entirely** (not just gitignored — never inside the project directory at all, so there's no rule to maintain or forget).
- `mode="upload"` queries build their retriever from `sessions.index_dir(session_id)` — there is no code path from there back to the demo/research corpus.
- `mode="demo"` queries never touch session storage at all, even if the same browser has uploaded files.

**Verified for real, not just unit-tested** (see commands below): a request with no session cookie gets a clean 400 ("No receipts uploaded"), not another session's data. A same-session query in `demo` mode answered from the synthetic corpus only, correctly ignoring an uploaded receipt that WAS in that session.

### Verification — commands actually run, with real output

```bash
# PDF with embedded text (generated on the fly with PyMuPDF, not a real receipt scan)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload -F "file=@test_receipt.pdf;type=application/pdf"
# -> page_count: 1, chunks_indexed: 1, text correctly extracted, used_ocr: false

curl -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "What is the total at Test Coffee Shop?", "mode": "upload"}'
# -> "The total at Test Coffee Shop is $10.54." (correct), source: test_receipt.pdf (correct)

# session isolation
curl -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "...", "mode": "upload"}'   # NO cookie sent
# -> 400 "No receipts uploaded in this session yet."

curl -b cookies.txt -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "...", "mode": "demo"}'  # SAME session, demo mode
# -> answered from synthetic corpus only (demo_* chunk_ids), upload never leaked in

# missing information
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST .../query -d '{"question": "How many loyalty points were earned?", "mode": "upload"}'
# -> "I don't know.", has_sufficient_evidence: false

# validation
curl -X POST .../upload -F "file=@notes.txt;type=text/plain"      # -> 400 Unsupported file type
curl -X POST .../upload -F "file=@big.png"  # 11MB                 # -> 413 exceeds 10MB limit
curl -X POST .../upload -F "file=@receipt.png"  # tesseract absent  # -> 503 clean OCR-unavailable message

# cleanup
curl -b cookies.txt http://127.0.0.1:8000/session   # files: [test_receipt.pdf], total_chunks: 1
curl -b cookies.txt -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/session   # {"cleared": true}
curl -b cookies.txt http://127.0.0.1:8000/session   # files: [], NEW session_id issued
ls /tmp/doc-rag-uploads/{old_session_id}   # -> No such file or directory (confirmed physically deleted)

# full test suite
pytest tests/ -v
# -> 25 passed (9 new upload tests: valid PDF extraction, 4 invalid-file cases,
#    cited-answer query, no-upload error, session isolation, deletion)
```

### New dependencies

`pymupdf` (PDF text extraction + page rasterization), `pytesseract` (OCR wrapper), `python-multipart` (FastAPI file-upload support) — all free, local, pip-only. System `tesseract-ocr` 5.3.4 — free, local, now installed and verified.

### Known limitations

- **No incremental indexing** — every new upload in a session rebuilds the whole session index from scratch. Fine at session scale (a handful of receipts), would not scale to many files per session.
- **Lazy expiry only** — sessions are swept on access, not by a background timer. A session that's never touched again after upload stays on disk until *something* triggers a sweep (the next request to this server, from anyone). Acceptable for a demo; a production deployment would want a periodic sweep task too.
- **CPU-only embedding for uploads** is a deliberate VRAM-safety tradeoff (see above), not a sign CPU is required — it's simply slower than the GPU-backed demo pipeline.

### Files changed/added this extension

New: `app/upload/` (5 files), `tests/test_upload.py`.
Modified: `app/main.py`, `app/rag_pipeline.py`, `app/schemas.py`, `app/config.py`, `.env.example`, `app/static/index.html`, `PROGRESS.md`.
Untouched: everything under `scripts/`, all research and demo corpus data, `PROJECT_GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `README.md`.

## Milestone 2 extension — better source citations (complete)

Manual testing (with your own, non-synthetic document) surfaced a real gap: the "supporting excerpt" shown with each answer was just the first 200 characters of the retrieved chunk — for a long document, that's often an unrelated header, not the passage the answer actually came from. Reported case: a payment-method question should show the payment-options lines, not the top of the page.

### Fix

`app/excerpt.py` (new, ~45 lines) — scores each line of the chunk by lexical word-overlap against the generated answer (weighted higher) and the question (weighted lower, and the only signal available in the no-answer/error case), then returns a short window of context around the best-matching line instead of the first N characters. No extra embedding or LLM call — pure Python, no added latency or cost. Wired into `app/rag_pipeline.py::_format_sources`, which now takes `question`/`answer` instead of just the retrieved results.

**Why answer-weighted, not question-only:** the generated answer text usually repeats the exact extracted value (a dollar amount, a name, a payment method) almost verbatim from the source, which is a much more precise grounding signal than the question's generic wording alone.

### Verified — real document, not just the unit tests

Per your instruction, tested on a **synthetic** document only (fabricated clinic-visit-style receipt, explicitly labeled "NOT A REAL PATIENT," fake name/dates/amounts) — never touched, read, or referenced anything from your actual upload, which went directly from your browser to the session-isolated server and was never accessible to me in the first place.

```
Q: "What payment method was used?"
A: "Mastercard ending in 4477."
excerpt (NEW): "Payment methods accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Cash, HSA
                Paid via: Mastercard ending in 4477
                Amount paid: 200.00"
```
Old behavior would have shown the clinic's name/address block instead — confirmed via a unit test (`test_excerpt_centers_on_answer_relevant_line_not_document_start`) that explicitly asserts the facility header is NOT in the new excerpt.

**Insufficient-evidence still verified correct** on the same document: asked about information genuinely absent (date of birth, insurance policy number) → `"I don't know."`, `has_sufficient_evidence: false`.

5 new unit tests (`tests/test_excerpt.py`) + full suite re-run: **30/30 passing**.

### Known limitation

Lexical overlap only — no semantic matching. In the insufficient-evidence test above, the excerpt shown was the "Date of service" line (matched on the shared word "date" with "date of birth"), not a deeper match — a fair, explainable miss given the approach, not a bug, but worth knowing: a semantically-themed question with no exact keyword overlap could still pick an excerpt that's lexically-close-but-conceptually-off. Not pursued further here since it doesn't affect the actual answer/evidence-flag correctness, only which excerpt is displayed alongside a correctly-flagged "I don't know."
